 <h1>Favorite things I read</h1> 
 <p>My favourite thing that I read was "the Optics" by Ibn Al-Haytham, It is an old book that theorizes on human vision and sight as well as tackling false theories on vision. 
  I was interested initially in exploring how Baghdad was before the it was invaded and subsequently destroyed by the Mongol empire, I had previously learnt that Baghdad was 
the centre of global academia and knowledge during the 10th and 11th centuries and after watching videos about the city's destruction and the emphasis on how major the loss 
of knowledge was, I was intrigued.     </p>
